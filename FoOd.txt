PROJECTS 
Digital Audio System(2023) 
  Designed a multi-feature digital audio synthesizer in Verilog on FPGA. 
  Implemented chord synthesis, ADSR modulation, echo effects, and waveform visualization. 
Class D Audio Amplifier & Speaker System (2023) 
  Built and optimized a Class D amplifier, focusing on signal fidelity and harmonic distortion. 
  Used oscilloscopes and network analyzers for debugging and performance tuning. 
Wearable Pulse PPG Sensor(2024) 
  Developed a biometric sensor PCB with Wi-Fi communication for real-time data display. 
  Integrated I²C/SPI protocols for efficient sensor interfacing. 
Network Latency Monitoring Web App (2024) 
  Developed a Flask-based web app to monitor real-time network latency in military systems. 
  Frontend with HTML/CSS/JS; backend TCP/UDP data handling in C; analyzed fiber-optic transmission. 
Autonomous Robot (2025) 
  Wrote master–slave Arduino C/C++ firmware with custom serial protocol for autonomous navigation. 
  Designed sensor fusion (ultrasonic, IR, IMU), motor drivers, and power circuits for competition. 
Dual-Wavelength UART over Fiber Optic (2025) 
  Achieved full-duplex UART on a single fiber by modulating blue/IR LEDs, decoding via custom TIA/comparator. 
  Measured BERs (100% blue, 90% IR) and optimized gain/filters for signal integrity. 
Machine Learning Optimized Flight Pathing(2025) 
  Built a Python simulator using Monte Carlo sampling and Bayesian updating for eVTOL risk assessment.
